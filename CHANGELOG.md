# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

*The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).*
## [2.9.3] - 2021-07-12
- added json overide for CLI vars
## [2.9.2] - 2021-06-11

### Changed
- Remove requirement for running user to have CREATE SCHEMA privileges for --create-change-history-table when schema already exists (#42)

## [2.9.1] - 2021-04-15

### Changed
- Bumped snowflake-connector-python to 2.4.2 and relaxed the pip dependency to ~= (pick the latest patch release 2.4.X on install)
- Bumped the docker container python version to 3.9 as snowflake-connector-python now supports this as of 2.4
- Created a 'Dockerfile-src' for users wanting to build schemachange themselves from source in Docker

## [2.9.0] - 2021-04-02

### Changed
- Renamed snowchange to schemachange
- Please be advised that the new default path for the change history table is now `METADATA.SCHEMACHANGE.CHANGE_HISTORY` (the schema name has been changed from `SNOWCHANGE` to `SCHEMACHANGE`). The easiest thing to do is rename the metadata schema in Snowflake. The other option is to leave it as is and use the `--change-history-table` (or `-c`) parameter to override the default.


## [2.8.0] - 2021-02-09

### Added
- Added a new optional parameter `--dry-run` to preview scripts that will be applied by snowchange.


## [2.7.0] - 2021-01-22

### Added
- Added a Snowflake query tag to all snowchange queries. If the query is issued by the tool the tag will be "snowchange #.#.#" (e.g. "snowchange 2.7.0") and if the query is part of a change script the tag will be "snowchange #.#.#;&lt;script name&gt;" (e.g. "snowchange 2.7.0;V1.1.1__initial_database_objects.sql")


## [2.6.1] - 2021-01-19

### Added
- Added a new optional parameter `-d` or `--snowflake-database` to specify the default database to use (which can always be overridden in an individual change script)
- Added a new optional parameter `--create-change-history-table` to create the change history table if it does not exist

### Changed
- The default mode of operation now is to not create the change history table if it doesn't exist. Instead, now if the history table doesn't exist the tool will fail by default.
- Added a check to see if the change history table exists before trying to create it, which is now also dependent upon the `--create-change-history-table` command line argument.
- Cleaned up command line argument descriptions

### Removed
- Removed the ability for snowchange to create the database for the change history table. snowchange now requires the database to be created ahead of time.


## [2.5.0] - 2020-12-23

### Added
- Support for encrypted key pair authentication


## [2.4.0] - 2020-11-24

### Added
- PyPI package support so that snowchange can be installed through pip
- Dockerfile for building Docker images

### Changed
- Allow for .SQL file extensions (common in Windows environments) in addition to .sql extensions


## [2.3.0] - 2020-10-05

### Added
- Support for "repeatable" scripts such as stored procedures, functions etc


## [2.2.0] - 2020-08-19

### Added
- Support for variables in change scripts (following a Jinja expression syntax)! See the [README](README.md) for more details.
- A new optional parameter `--vars` which accepts a JSON formatted string of variables and values (e.g. `{"variable1": "value1", "variable2": "value2"}`)

### Changed
- Add the Snowflake account name to the script output to provide more log context

### Removed
- Removed the deprecated `--snowflake-region` parameter. Instead use the `-a` or `--snowflake-account` account parameter. See [Usage Notes for the account Parameter (for the connect Method)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/python-connector-api.html#label-account-format-info) for more details on how to structure the account name.


## [2.1.0] - 2020-05-26

### Added
- Support for cross-database dependencies!
- Support for override the location and name of the change history table with the new parameter `--change-history-table` (or `-c`)
- Change log for snowchange project (this CHANGELOG.md file)

### Changed
- The required project folder structure, removing the database folder convention
- Where the change history table gets created and how it gets named
- The schema of the change history table (removed INSTALLED_RANK and renamed/reordered a few columns)
- Updated the getting started section of the README.md to make the getting started steps more clear

### Removed
- The ability for snowchange to create user databases directly (now the user must explicity do so in their change scripts)
- The `--environment-name` and `--append-environment-name` parameters
